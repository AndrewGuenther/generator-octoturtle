## Creating Rules

Place your rules in `hooks.js`. You can read more about how to write auditor
rules in the [Octoturtle docs][0]

## Deploying

You may deploy your express based webhook server in whatever environment best
suits your needs. Simply run `npm start` to start your server.

### Setting up your Webhook

Github's own documentation provides an excellent explanation of how to configure
and create your webhook: https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/
